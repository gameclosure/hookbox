This demo displays a Graphic EQ that is dynamically updated based
on data published by the server on channel "chan1".

A producer process (producer.py) generates random data and uses
Hookbox's REST api to publish the data on the channel mentioned above.

A Quixote based web application (webapp.py) serves the main page and also
handles call backs from the Hookbox process.

jQuery and jQuery-ui are used on the web page to render the sliders
which make up our EQ widget.

How To Run
----------

 0. Install hookbox and Quixote using some or all of the following steps
   - easy_install hookbox
   - easy_install quixote
   - easy_install pyjsiocompile (hookbox depends on this).
 1. In terminal 1: `sudo ./webapp.py`
 2. In terminal 2: `sudo hookbox -d -r altoids -p 2974 --cbhost=127.0.0.1 --cbport=8080 --cbpath=`
 3. In terminal 3: `sudo ./producer.py`
 4. In Firefox: goto http://localhost:8080
